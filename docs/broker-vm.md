# Broker VM (Vector)

A broker VM is a small Linux machine that sits close to your log sources, receives their syslog, and forwards
it to the ASIX data node. It holds no database credentials: it only knows one URL and one ingestion key, so a
stolen or exposed broker can be cut off by revoking that key.

```
devices ──syslog UDP/TCP 514──> Vector (broker VM) ──HTTPS + ingestion key──> /v1/ingest/http (ASIX)
                                   │ disk buffer (1 GiB)                              │
                                   └─ heartbeat every 60 s ────────────────────> /v1/ingest/heartbeat
```

## What you get
- **Syslog in:** UDP and TCP on one port (default 514), RFC 3164 and RFC 5424.
- **No server change for parsing:** Vector rewrites each event as `ISO-time host app[pid]: message`, which the
  HTTP lane already parses into host, app name, pid and event time, so existing parsing rules and the data
  model apply unchanged.
- **Survives outages:** events wait in a 1 GiB on-disk buffer when ASIX is down or rebooting, and the sources
  slow down instead of dropping when it is full. Retries back off to once a minute.
- **Per-broker identity:** one ingestion key per broker (revocable, shown with its name on the Collectors page).
  This replaces the shared `BROKER_INGEST_TOKEN` for brokers outside the cluster.
- **Heartbeat:** a one-minute timer tells ASIX the broker is alive, so a quiet broker stays **Connected**. It
  sends nothing when Vector is not healthy, so a broken broker turns Disconnected (after 15 minutes).

## Install
1. In the portal: **Settings > Collectors > Installers**, create an installer (platform `linux`), name it like the
   broker (for example `broker-1`), and copy the key. It is shown once.
2. Copy the repo's `deploy/broker/` and `scripts/deploy/bootstrap-broker.sh` to the broker VM (Debian or Ubuntu),
   then as root:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy/bootstrap-broker.sh --url https://asix1/v1/ingest/http --key asix_ik_... --name broker-1
   ```
   For the self-signed nginx certificate add `--ca /path/to/that-certificate.pem`. If Vector is already
   installed (offline or pinned version) add `--no-install`.
3. Open port 514 (UDP and TCP) on the broker VM's firewall for the devices that send syslog, and point those
   devices at the broker VM.
4. Check: `logger -n 127.0.0.1 -P 514 -T 'asix broker test'`, then **Settings > Collectors** should show
   `broker-1` as Connected, and the line appears under search.

The script validates the Vector config before restarting, and is safe to re-run (for example to change the key).

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `deploy/broker/vector.yaml` | Vector config: syslog sources, line rewrite, HTTP sink with disk buffer |
| `deploy/broker/vector-tests.yaml` | Vector unit tests for the line format: `vector test deploy/broker/vector.yaml deploy/broker/vector-tests.yaml` |
| `deploy/broker/broker.env.example` | Settings (`/etc/asix-broker/broker.env` on the VM, mode 640) |
| `deploy/broker/vector-asix.conf` | systemd drop-in: loads the env file, lets Vector bind port 514 |
| `deploy/broker/asix-broker-heartbeat.{sh,service,timer}` | The one-minute heartbeat |
| `scripts/deploy/bootstrap-broker.sh` | Installs and starts everything |
| `src/ingest/heartbeat.js` | Server side: `POST /v1/ingest/heartbeat` (ingestion key) |

## Heartbeat API
- `POST /v1/ingest/heartbeat` with `Authorization: Bearer asix_ik_...`. Optional JSON
  `{"collector":{"name","platform","os","version"}}` or the `X-ASIX-*` headers used by the HTTP lane; the name
  defaults to the key's name. Creates or refreshes the collector row (`last_seen`), writes no event and no audit
  row. Limit: 30 per minute per key (`HEARTBEAT_RATE_PER_MIN`).
- `POST /v1/ingest/heartbeat/broker` with the shared `BROKER_INGEST_TOKEN` and
  `{"tenant_id" | "tenant_name", "collector_id", "version"}`. Used by the in-cluster syslog collector
  (`src/ingestion/syslog-server.js` sends it every 60 s; `SYSLOG_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS=0` turns it off,
  `INGEST_HEARTBEAT_URL` overrides the address). The row is key-less, which the Collectors page shows as
  **built-in**, merged with the event counts it already derived from events.

## Limits and not built yet
- One syslog port for UDP and TCP, no TLS syslog (RFC 5425) listener and no non-syslog sources (files, Windows
  events, Kafka) on the broker yet.
- The broker is not managed from the portal (no remote config push, upgrade or capacity view); the portal only
  sees it as a collector. `src/brokers/broker-framework.js` is still the Phase 3 placeholder.
- A 4xx other than 408/429 from ASIX (for example a revoked key) is not retried by Vector, so those events are
  dropped; fix the key and re-run the bootstrap script.
- The connected/disconnected threshold is still 15 minutes for every collector.
